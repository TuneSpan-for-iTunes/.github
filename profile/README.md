## ✨ About TuneSpan for iTunes

When music collections grow beyond internal storage space, it becomes a challenge to keep things organized. TuneSpan for iTunes addresses this problem by letting you move music files (along with all metadata, artwork, and playlists) from your main drive to secondary storage without breaking anything in iTunes. The result is a clean library, more free space, and no lost tracks or missing artwork.

Relocation is smart: TuneSpan retains all track data such as play counts, last played dates, ratings, and preserves the structure of your playlists. Because the tracks are moved, not duplicated, your storage usage becomes more efficient. If you re-connect external drives, or change paths, the library still resolves correctly, avoiding the dreaded “file not found” issue.

Another benefit is automation: you can set rules based on play count, last played date, or disk usage thresholds. For example, tracks not played in a year can be moved automatically. This frees up local storage while keeping your favorites easily accessible. TuneSpan works seamlessly with both internal and external drives, including USB, Thunderbolt, or network-mounted volumes.

The application is optimized for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, so performance is smooth even with large libraries. It uses efficient checks to avoid redundant operations and ensures metadata integrity with each move. Whether you’re a casual listener, an audiophile, or someone with tens of thousands of songs, TuneSpan provides control, safety, and flexibility.
